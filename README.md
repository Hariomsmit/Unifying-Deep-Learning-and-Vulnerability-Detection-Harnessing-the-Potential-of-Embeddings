## Abstract

Deep learning techniques have shown promising results in various natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for unifying deep learning and vulnerability detection by harnessing the potential of embeddings. Our method involves leveraging sentence embeddings generated from preprocessed source codes, followed by utilizing a BERT-based pretrained model for creating these embeddings. Subsequently, we employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for classifying the source code dataset into vulnerable and non-vulnerable categories. The proposed approach aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of vulnerability detection by leveraging the power of deep learning techniques and the representational capabilities of embeddings. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on a benchmark dataset and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing methods. The results showcase the potential of combining deep learning and vulnerability detection, providing a promising avenue for future research and applications. The proposed methodology opens up new possibilities for improving the security and reliability of software systems through advanced machine learning techniques.

## Introduction

Vulnerability detection plays a critical role in ensuring the security and reliability of software systems. Traditional approaches to vulnerability detection often rely on rule-based methods or pattern matching techniques, which have limitations in accurately identifying complex vulnerabilities. With the advent of deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, there is a growing interest in leveraging these approaches for vulnerability detection tasks.

In this paper, we present a novel approach that unifies deep learning and vulnerability detection by harnessing the potential of embeddings. Embeddings have emerged as powerful representations that capture semantic information in a compact and continuous space. By leveraging sentence embeddings derived from preprocessed source codes, we aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of vulnerability detection.
